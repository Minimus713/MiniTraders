# MiniTraders
Project using SpaceTraders API - https://spacetraders.io/

A fun project to get me coding for fun again! 

Frontend - ReactJS using TypeScript
Backend (if any) - Express using TypeScript. Maybe try Nest? 


## Goal
The main goal of this project is to work on a fun project without a focus on learning a ton of new stuff or developing a certain skill. Just have fun and make something cool.

I want to create a cool user facing interface that allows a person to manually start and play the game of SpaceTraders. The second part of this will be to automate tasks for the player. Ideally allowing them to choose what they automate and what not.
